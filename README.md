# unsupervised-RA-methods
These unsupervised RA methods were tested on our preprocessed dataset and the results of our preprocessing are in the folder. There are more than 20 of these methods including old RA methods and new RA methods, if there is a need to test other datasets, please follow the comments in the code for dataset preprocessing and code modification.

## Getting Started
To run your example in Python, open the /.py file and place your rankings in the variable "ranking" (each column correspondes to rankings produced by an MCDM method).

## test demonstrations
We selected several different unsupervised RA methods for simple test demonstrations, as can be seen in 

If you have problems using the code or have suggestions for changes, please contact waii2022@whu.edu.cn
